My training and research for the past 8 years has focused on Bayesian model, variable selection, smoothing process, high dimensional longitudinal data, and clinical trial design. My current research interests include hierarchical models, variable selection in Bayesian model, the linkage between Bayes and frequentist procedures, infectious disease data like COVID19, smoothing process.


### Research

#### Bayesian model
##### [Bayesian Hierarchical Temporal Sparse Regression Model: Estimation of Stillbirth Rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03551)

We compiled data and developed a Bayesian hierarchical temporal sparse regressionmodel for estimating stillbirth rates for all countries from 2000 to 2019. Themodel  combines  covariates  with  a  temporal  smoothing  process  so  that  es-timates are data-driven in country-periods with high-quality data and deter-mined by covariates for country-periods with limited or no data. Horseshoepriors are used to encourage sparseness
